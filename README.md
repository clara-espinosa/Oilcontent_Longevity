## Abstract

- **Background** Seed oil content is a crucial energy reserve in
  angiosperms, with effects on biological functions and plant fitness,
  playing an important role in seed protection from environmental
  conditions. However, the eco‐evolutionary role of seed oil traits in
  natural ecosystems is largely unexplored.

- **Methods** We studied functional trade‐offs and ecological drivers of
  seed oil traits in 47 species of an alpine flora. We analysed seed oil
  content and composition – relative proportion of unsaturated and
  saturated fatty acids (UFA/SFA) – and their relationships with seed
  mass, seed longevity, and germination timing. We also tested the
  response of seed oil traits to species’ ecological preferences along
  microclimatic gradients.

- **Key Results** Seed oil content ranged from 1% to 34.2%, with the
  main variation explained by the UFA/SFA ratio, and little variation
  across altitude.Seed oil content significantly influenced seed
  longevity but had no relationships to seed mass and germination.
  Contrary to expectations, microclimatic gradients did not affect seed
  oil content or composition. All analyses showed strong phylogenetic
  constraints on seed oil traits.

- **Conclusion** Seed oil traits in alpine species do not differ from
  those of other herbaceous species. A major trade‐off between seed oil
  and seed longevity may help in understanding species regeneration in
  alpine soils and defining protocols for ex‐situ conservation. The
  evolutionary conservatism of seed oil traits likely prevents selective
  responses of alpine species across altitudinal and microclimatic
  gradients.
